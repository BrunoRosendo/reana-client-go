const description = `
Delete a workflow.

The ` + "``delete``" + ` command removes workflow run(s) from the database. Note that
the workspace will always be deleted, even when ` + "``--include-workspace``" + ` is
not specified. Note also that you can remove all past runs of a workflow by
specifying ` + "``--include-all-runs``" + ` flag.

Example:

$ reana-client delete -w myanalysis.42

$ reana-client delete -w myanalysis.42 --include-all-runs
`
